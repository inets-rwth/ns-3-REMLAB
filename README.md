The Network Simulator, Version 3, REMLAB framework
================================

This ns-3 code is based on the work proposed in the paper:

[1] A. Schott, A. Palovandov, E. Tosi, M. Petrova, and L. SimiÄ‡, 'REMLAB: Full-Stack ns-3 Framework for REM-Based Location-Aided Beam Management in 5G-NR Networks', accepted for IEEE MobiWac 2025

This framework enables REM-based location-aided beam management in millimeter-wave end-to-end network simulations.
If you use this module in your research, please cite [1].

## Building the code
The code for the framework and the default models provided by ns-3 is built as a set of libraries. User simulations are expected to be written as simple programs that make use of these ns-3 libraries.

To build the set of default libraries and the example programs included in this package, you need to use the tool 'waf':

```shell
./waf configure --disable-werror
```
```shell
./waf build
```
in the directory which contains this README file. The files built will be copied in the build/ directory.

The REMLAB ns-3 framework is built as an extension to the [ns-3 5G-LENA module](https://github.com/QiuYukang/5G-LENA), which is a pluggable module to the ns-3 base simulator.

## Running ns-3-REMLAB
On recent Linux systems, once you have built ns-3, it should be easy to run the sample program with the following command:

```shell
./waf --run main_REMLAB.cc
```

The simulation results generated by this program can be found in /out/test/.
